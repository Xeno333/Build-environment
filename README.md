# Build-environment
Build environment for my OSs

Copy OS and Bootloader into the SRC path, then run build.sh.
The Bootloader made in two parts (This may change and there may become a difrent bootloader configuration that will be installed on the image via a script that comes with the bootload, but as of now this is not the case and it is all done with this script.)

Bootloader needs to be placed in ./SRC/Boot.
Kernel goes in ./SRC/kernel.
These must be created by the user.
